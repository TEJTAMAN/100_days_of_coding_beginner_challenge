1. Learn the terms: initialization, declaration and assignment of variables


Initialization:
The method for initializing a variable depends on the programming language and the type and storage class of the variable.
Initialization can be done by embedding the value at compile time or by assigning it at run time.


Declaration:
Declarations are commonly used for variables, functions, constants, and classes.
In strongly typed languages, declarations are required to specify the types of variables, functions, and constants before they can be used.


Assignment:
The assignment operator, typically =, is used to assign a value to a variable.


2. Learn the difference between Dynamically typed and Statically typed variables


Dynamically typed:
Data types are determined at runtime, while the code is being executed. 
This allows for more flexibility, but can lead to unexpected errors. 
Examples include Python, Ruby, and JavaScript.


Statically typed:
Data types are determined at compile time, before the code is executed.
This provides stricter control over variable types, but can lead to better code optimization. 
Examples include Java, C++, and C#.
